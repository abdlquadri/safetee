    <!-- Reporting FAQ-->
    <string name="reporting_faq1_header">What is the difference between a Restricted Report and a Standard Report?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq1">
        Both types of reports are confidential in nature. Until you provide Peace Corps with your preference, staff will treat your
        information as if you filed a Restricted Report.\n\n

        A Restricted Report limits your information to only those individuals who have a specific need-to-know that information in order
        to provide you with basic services (medical, mental health, or safety).\n\n

        A Standard Report allows you to access all of the same services offered through Restricted Reporting in addition to other support
        services such as filing a police report, switching host families, and changing to a new site. Because additional services
        may be requested, a Standard Report increases the number of people with a need-to-know.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq2_header">Should I choose Standard or Restricted?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq2">
        The choice between filing a Standard or Restricted Report is an individual one. Some services, however, can only be
        offered under standard reporting. Peace Corps believes it can best support you through standard reporting as it allows
        the agency to leverage additional resources and offer additional services such as conducting an in-depth risk assessment.
        The agency recognizes however that for some Volunteers the most important thing is strict confidentiality and a need for
        as few people to know as possible.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq3_header">What does “need-to-know” mean?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq3">
        A need-to-know means that someone has a specific role that requires basic knowledge about the assault. Only service
        providers typically have a need-to-know and therefore have access to information about the assault as reported by you.
        Only medical staff have information about any medical treatment you receive.\n\n

        A role may be mandated by Peace Corps policies and procedures, US law, or local laws. For example, a Country Director has
        a responsibility to know where each Volunteer is located and new site development requires time and resources managed by
        the Country Director. As such, a Country Director has a need-to-know when a Volunteer requests a site change.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq4_header">What if I change my mind later?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq4">
        All reports start as a Restricted Report. A Volunteer can change from Restricted to Standard at any time. Once a report
        becomes Standard, the report cannot be converted back to Restricted because staff that might help provide additional standard
        report services will have been provided with basic information.\n\n
        Volunteers can request additional services at any time, and Volunteers can discontinue/cancel a request for services at any
        time.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq5_header">Will I get the services/type of reporting I want?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq5">
        Volunteer preferences are very important to Peace Corps. We strive to ensure that Volunteer choices are respected. In
        most cases Volunteers receive all the services they desire. Where something is not possible, Peace Corps staff have a
        responsibility to explain why a service is not possible.\n\n

        Because Peace Corps staff members have a responsibility to protect not only you, but other Volunteers, there may be limited
        situations that require the agency to either disclose your name or convert your report from Restricted to Standard.  This is
        most likely in situations where staff believe there is a serious or imminent threat to your health or safety that Peace Corps
        cannot mitigate without additional support or resources. Conversion of a report without a Volunteer’s consent are very rare.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq6_header">What is a SARL?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq6">
        A SARL is a Sexual Assault Response Liaison. SARLs are typically Peace Corps staff that have had training in how to support
        people that have experienced a sexual assault. SARLs help Volunteers with issues not handled by the PCMO or SSM. For example,
        a SARL might accompany a Volunteer when traveling to an appointment with a local lawyer.

    <string name="radar_step1">
        &lt;b>Recognize the danger&lt;/b>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Be aware of what is going on around you – be on the lookout for suspicious people and for situations that could pose a danger.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Be aware of how others perceive you – are your actions or dress inadvertently attracting unwanted attention?  Are you wearing jewelry, using a camera, working on a laptop, or flashing money that might grab the attention of a criminal?&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Being able to recognize dangers lets us begin to figure out ways to reduce the risks. This is where it’s important to trust your instincts. If you have a bad feeling about something it’s a warning sign. Don’t dismiss it – listen to what that voice in the back of your head is saying or that uneasy feeling in your stomach is telling you.
        For example, when you walk in to a crowded bus terminal, you recognize that there is a risk of being pickpocketed.
    </string>
    <string name="radar_step2">
        &lt;b>Assess your options&lt;/b> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Now that you have recognized a potentially dangerous situation, what can you do in order to reduce the risk you face? In most situations, you will have choices to make. Identify as many options as you can.  For example, you can mitigate the risk
        of going out at night by traveling in a group, by using a trusted taxi or even by choosing to return home at an earlier hour.
    </string>
    <string name="radar_step3">
        &lt;b>Decide what’s best for you&lt;/b> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        After figuring out what options you have, run the different scenarios in your head – say ‘What if’ – and decide which option is the best. You could try to defuse the situation by remaining calm and use good communication skills to keep the situation from escalating.  Maybe try an escape option
        where you run towards safety, not just away from danger.  As a last resort, try a verbal, psychological, or physical defense tactic.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Sometimes your best option might be a bit unconventional. If it’s the best option to keep you safe, then it’s a good option.
    </string>
    <string name="radar_step4">
        &lt;b>Act when the time is right&lt;/b> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        After you decide on your best course of action, decide when to act. Sometimes you’ll need to act right away. Other times you can wait until the danger gets closer – but don’t wait until it gets too close! &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        Draw your own imaginary line – set your own personal tripwire. Once the danger crosses that line – whatever you decided for yourself – that’s when you act.
    </string>
    <string name="radar_step5">
        &lt;b>Reassess as the situation changes&lt;/b> &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        And because no situation is static, you must constantly reassess your options as the conditions and circumstances change. If you encounter new risks or if you run out of options, start the cycle again.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>

        &lt;b>Characteristics of Sexual Assault&lt;/b>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>\t\t\t&lt;b>Sexual predators often plan sexual assaults&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            ·\t\t\tSexual assault is not an accident.  Sexual predators know what they want to do, even if they have not already identified a specific target.  Most of them have a plan in mind for how they will select and control someone, or they will seek out an area where a potential victim might be isolated and unable to get help. When we say planned to some extent it may not mean days or weeks in advance but also planned in the particular moment.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>\t\t\t&lt;b>Sexual predators often watch for vulnerabilities and opportunities&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            ·\t\t\tSexual predators look for cues to indicate they can dominate and control a potential victim. They look for signs indicating that someone would be unlikely or unable to resist.  For instance, people who are unaware of their surroundings, alone or lost; someone who is intoxicated or in some way incapacitated.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>\t\t\t&lt;b>Sexual predators often test the boundaries of potential victims&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            ·\t\t\tTesting boundaries may involve inappropriate comments, unwanted touching or invading personal space. It is a way of measuring the amount of resistance a potential victim might offer. A person who offers little or no resistance to these advances might be seen as a suitable target.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
    </string>

    <string name="tactics_2">
        &lt;b>Tactics of Sexual Assault&lt;/b>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tAttempt to isolate their potential victim&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\t They may target someone who is already alone. For example, walking alone, or they may try to get their target alone by offering a ride in their car.&lt;br/> &lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tPersuasion and confidence&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tThis is the “Smooth Talker” who puts you at ease.  They make you feel comfortable and relaxed so you are not aware of their true intent.  They may try to persuade you to do something you feel uncomfortable about.  They might promise that they won’t try anything with you or reassure you by saying “You can trust me.”&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tPressure and guilt&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tSexual predators may try to coerce you by pressuring you to go farther in a relationship than you are ready or willing to go.  They may try to make you feel guilty if you do not give in to their advances. They might say “You are offending me culturally” or something similar to make Volunteers feel guilty.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tThreats and intimidation&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tSometimes the sexual predator threatens to physically harm the Volunteer or someone they care about.  They might also threaten to blackmail the Volunteer unless they comply.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
        &lt;b>•&lt;/b>&lt;b>\t\t\tForce and violence&lt;/b>&lt;br/>
            \t\t\tForce and Violence involves a direct physical attack to overpower a Volunteer.  It is what we frequently see on TV and in movies…like when the assailant jumps out of the bushes with a knife and attacks an unsuspecting jogger.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>
